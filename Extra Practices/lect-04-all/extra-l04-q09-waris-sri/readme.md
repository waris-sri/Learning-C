## Lesson 04 Extra Practice: Q9
Write a C program that simulates a **simple guessing game**. The program should generate a random number between **1 and 100** (inclusive) and ask the user to `guess the number`. The user should continue to guess until they correctly guess the number. 

**Note:** 

* the program must use a `do-while` **loop** for this purpose.
* You need to use library `stdlib.h` and using `rand()` to random a number.
* This problem has **no** test case.
