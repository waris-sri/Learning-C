## Lesson 04 Extra Practice: Q6
Write a program that prints English letters from `'a' to 'z'` with a **comma (,) separating** them **using LOOP statements**. The program prints the `UPPERCASE` letters at the
**even** position, and the `lowercase` letters at the **odd** position. `'A'` is the 1st position, `'b'`
is the 2nd position, and so on. 

(**Hint:** the ASCII code for `'A'` is `65` and `'a'` is `97`)

**Note:** There is _no comma_ after the last letter

**Expected output:**
```
a, B, c, D, e, F, g, H, i, J, k, L, m, N, o, P, q, R, s, T, u, V, w, X, y, Z
```
