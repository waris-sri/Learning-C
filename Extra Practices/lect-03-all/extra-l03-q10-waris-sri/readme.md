## Lesson 03 Extra Practice: Q11
Write a C program to find the "Greatest Common Divisor" (GCD) of two non-zero integers: `a` and `b`, where `a < b`. The Greatest Common Divisor, or GCD, is the largest integer that can divide both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.

The program should take two integers as input and then calculate the GCD of these two numbers and display the result. If the two numbers have no common divisors (e.g., 2 and 3), the GCD will be 1.

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `a = 3 , b = 3` 
```
3 3
```
**Expected output:**
```
3
```

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `a = 2 , b = 3` 
```
2 3
```
**Expected output:**
```
1
```

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `a = 24 , b = 36` 
```
24 36
```
**Expected output:**
```
12
