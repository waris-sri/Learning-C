## Lesson 03 Extra Practice: Q10
Write a C program to find the number of digits, the first digit, the last digit, and the sum of the first and last digits of an input `x`. 

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `x = 123456` 
```
123456
```
**Expected output:** After calculation, the program should display the following results:

- 6 is the number of digits (123456 has 6 digits).
- 1 is the first digit (123456 starts with 1).
- 6 is the last digit (123456 ends with 6).
- 7 (1+6) is the sum of the first and last digits.
```
6 1 6 7
```

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `x = 5810230` 
```
5810230
```
**Expected output:** After calculation, the program should display the following results:

- 7 is the number of digits.
- 5 is the first digit.
- 0 is the last digit.
- 5 (5+0) is the sum of the first and last digits.
```
7 5 0 5
```

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `x = 2` 
```
2
```
**Expected output:** After calculation, the program should display the following results:

- 1 is the number of digits.
- 2 is both the first and last digit.
- 4 (2+2) is the sum of the first and last digits.
```
1 2 2 4
```
