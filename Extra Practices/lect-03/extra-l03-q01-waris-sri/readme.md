## Lesson 03 Extra Practice: Q1
In particular, the program first receives a number, `n`. It then prints out all of the even numbers between 2 and `n` (inclusively) in an *ascending* and a *descending* order.

If the given number is **less than 2**, print out "Unable to print the sequence".

**Hint**
* You can use `if-else` with `%` to check for an even number
* Ascending order -> increasing order
* Descending order -> decreasing order

**Case 1**

Sample input:
```
7
```
Sample output:
```
2 4 6 
6 4 2 
```

**Case 2**

Sample input:
```
14
```
Sample output:
```
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 
14 12 10 8 6 4 2 
```

**Case 3**

Sample input:
```
-9
```
Sample output:
```
Unable to print the sequence
```
