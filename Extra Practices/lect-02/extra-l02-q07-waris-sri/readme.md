## Lesson 02 Extra Practice: Q7
Write the program to calculate the EV Car Charging **Rate**: 

1. Recieve `Battery Capacity` (kW) and `Charging Speed` (kW/hr)
2. The program will calculate from these conditions:
* In first 2 hours, Charging rate is **4 Baht per kW**.
* After that, Charging rate will be **5 Baht per kW**.

The program should display the **spending hour** and the **result** of **charging rate** in two decimal places.

**Note:** Assume that battery should be charge from **0% to 100%**

<hr>

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `capacity = 45, charge_speed = 7.4`  
```
45
7.4
```
**Expected output:**
```
6.08 28.41
```
<hr>

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `capacity = 60, charge_speed = 10` 
```
60
10
```
**Expected output:**
```
6.00 28.00
```
<hr>

**Example 3:**
**Input:** `capacity = 60, charge_speed = 10` 
```
60
10
```
**Expected output:**
```
6.00 28.00
```
