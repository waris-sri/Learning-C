## Lesson 02 Extra Practice: Q12
Write a C program to calculate the pay for a **Teaching Assistant (TA) or Learning Assistant (LA)**.

- If the LA works **less than or equal** to `40 hours per week`, they will be paid `50 baht per hour`.
- Otherwise, the LA will receive a base pay of `2000 baht` and an additional `75 baht per hour` for every hour worked over 40.

The program must take the number of hours worked per week (hr) as input and display the calculated pay as output.

**Note:**
- Do not use other **built-in functions** as this is a practice in thinking processes. Only **basic operators** are allowed.

<hr>

**Example 1:**
**Input:** `hr = 32`  
```
32
```
**Expected output:**
```
1600
```
<hr>

**Example 2:**
**Input:** `hr = 64`  
```
64
```
**Expected output:**
```
3800
```
<hr>
