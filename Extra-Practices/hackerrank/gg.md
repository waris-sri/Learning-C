# Battle Rules

- This is the turn-based system, so the Monster will take turns attacking each
  other.
- **The fastest (speed) Monster will attack first.**
- If the speed is equal, **the first in the list (based on the user choice) would
  start the attack first.**

# Element Rules

- **Fire**: stronger than Plant, weaker than Water
- **Water**: stronger than Fire , weaker than Plant
- **Plant**: stronger than Water, weaker than Fire

# Element Factors

- If you hit the monster that's stronger than you, your attack will be reduced
  to 50% (x0.5).
- If you hit the monster that's weaker than you, your attack would be increased
  by 200% (x2.0).
- Otherwise, the factor will be 1

# Damage

The formula of damage from monster A (attacker) to monster B (defender) is

```plaintext
Damage to B = (Attack of A x the element factor) - Defense power of B
                              â†³ either 0.5 or 2.0
```

- If the Defense is higher than Attack, the attack power becomes 0
- If the Attack is higher than Defense, the defense power becomes 0
- The attack won't reduce the HP to less than zero

For example:

- Monster A: atk 120, def 30
- Monster B: atk 50, def 70

- **If they are on the same element:**

  - A attack B = (120 x 1.0) - 70 = 50

- **If A is stronger than B:**
  - A attack B = (120 x 2.0) - 70 = 170
- **If A is weaker than B:**
  - A attack B = (120 x 0.5) - 70 = 0 (since 60-70 is negative)

**_Clip negative values to 0_**
