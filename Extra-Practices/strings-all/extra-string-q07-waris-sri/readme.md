## String Extra Practice: Q7 (Manage String)

Write your code in the provided sections to complete a program.

This program first recieves two input strings `name1` , `name2`. Then, it calls function `manage_string`. The function prototype of manage_string is provided as follows.

```
int manage_string(char *a1, char *a2);
```

The manage_string function is used to swap the values of two input strings.

The manage_string function is used to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o and u) occurance found from two input strings.

**For example:** a word `CheesE` contains 3 vowels occurance (e, e and E)

The manage_string will return the number of vowels found from two input
strings.

**Finally,** the program prints string in name1 , name2 , and the number of vowels found from two input strings.

**Note:** 

* We assume that the number of characters in name1 and name2 are less than or equal to 9.
* You can create new variables but cannot delete the exiting variables.
* You are allowed to make use of the built-in functions in `<string.h>`
* You are **NOT** allowed to modify the other parts of the code, except the provided sections. Otherwise, you will get a **ZERO** score.

**Case 1**

**Sample input:** name1 = `mickey` and name2 = `MOUSE`
```
mickey
MOUSE
```
**Sample output:** name1 = `MOUSE`, name2 = `mickey` and the number of vowels = `5`
```
MOUSE
mickey
5
```

<hr>

**Case 2**
**Sample input:** name1 = `MARIO` and name2 = `mark`
```
MARIO
mark
```
**Sample output:** name1 = `mark`, name2 = `MARIO` and the number of vowels = `4`
```
mark
MARIO
4
```

<hr>

**Case 3**
**Sample input:** name1 = `xyz` and name2 = `BCD`
```
xyz
BCD
```
**Sample output:** name1 = `BCD`, name2 = `MARIO` and the number of vowels = 0
```
BCD
xyz
0
```
