## Function Extra Practice: Q12 (Define Many Functions)

## Instructions

Please write function prototypes and functions for the following questions.

1. Write a function `sum` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.
2. Write a function `square` that takes a single integer as an argument and returns its square.
3. Write a function `array_sum` that takes an integer array and its size as arguments and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.
4. Write a function `array_average` that takes an integer array and its size as arguments and returns the average of all the elements in the array.
5. Write a function `max` that takes two integers as arguments and returns the larger of the two.
6. Write a function `max_index` that takes an integer array and its size as arguments and returns the index of the largest element in the array.
7. Write a function `is_even` that takes a single integer as an argument and returns true if the integer is even, and false otherwise.
8. Write a function `is_prime` that takes a single integer as an argument and returns true if the integer is prime, and false otherwise. Hint: The is_prime function is used to determine whether an input number is a prime number.  
    - It returns 1 (i.e., true) when the input is a prime.
    - It returns 0 (i.e., false) when the input is not a prime.
9. Write a function `power` that takes two integers as arguments and returns the result of raising the first integer to the power of the second integer. *You must **not** use `math.h`.*

Uncomment code in `main` function to test your functions
