## Function Extra Practice: Q5 (Factorial Return)

### ======== Please use code template in main.c to start your coding. =========

Write a program to calculate a factorial of an input number. The factorial can be computed as follows:

```
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
```

**Note:** 

* There is a special case where `0! = 1`
* You **must** to use function to use this problem.
