## Lesson 02 Extra Practice: Q13
Write a C program that toggles the case of an input character (e.g., A -> a or a -> A), and prints out the toggled case. If a user inputs a symbol (e.g., &, $, *, #, â€¦), do nothing.

**IMPORTANT**: you are NOT allowed to use any functions in `ctype.h` to toggle the character. You MUST toggle the character yourself.
