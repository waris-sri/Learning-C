## Lesson 02 Extra Practice: Q11
Write a **`Fizz Buzz`** program to receive a positive integer.

* If the number is **divisible by 3**, the program should display `Fizz`
* If the number is **divisible by 5**, the program should display `Buzz`
* If the number is **divisible by both 3 and 5**, the program should display `Fizz Buzz`
* If the number is **not divisible by either 3 and 5**, the program should display the **input number**
* If the user inputs an invalid number, such as **0 or any negative integer**, the program should display `Invalid`

**Note:**
- Do not use other **built-in functions** as this is a practice in thinking processes. Only **basic operators** are allowed.
