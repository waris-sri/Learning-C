Write your code in the provided sections to complete a program.

This program first finds and points the pointer `p_max` to the maximum of an input array. Then it replaces the maximum value with `42` via the pointer `p_max`. Finally, the program prints out all of the values in the array.

**Note**:

- You are **NOT** allowed to modify the other parts of the code, except the provided sections. Otherwise, you will get a ZERO score.
- Please read the *TODO* in the provided code.
- If you **DO NOT** use the pointer or **DO NOT** follow the instructions in *TODO* to complete the program, you will get a ZERO score.

**Case 1**
Sample input:
```
5
1 -3 2 5 4
```
Sample output:
```
Replace max=5 with 42
1 -3 2 42 4 
```

**Case 2**
Sample input:
```
3
15 15 15
```
Sample output:
```
Replace max=15 with 42
42 15 15 
```
