# Find Max

Given the code, please write a function `findmax` to take in 4 parameters of address of n1,n2,n3, and max.

The function prototype will be `void findmax(int *x, int *y, int*z, int *max)`.

The program first recieves the value of n1,n2,n3 from the user. Then, the function `findmax` is called from main(). Among the three values of function parameters, the function `findmax` will then assign the maximum value to max variable. The result is printed in the main() as a final output.
