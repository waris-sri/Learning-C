## Find a bug

The given code is trying to multiply 2 adjacent numbers in the `DATA` array, and print out the maximum value of the multiplication. From a quick check, the max value should be `6 * 7 = 42`, but this program prints out `0`. Please find and fix a bug in this program.

**IMPORTANT**: Your modification MUST be related to variable scope. Any cheating attempt to make the answer passes the test case will result in a **ZERO** score.

**Hint**: the bug involves variable scope.
