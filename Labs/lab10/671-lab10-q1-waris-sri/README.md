## Fill in function calls

This exercise is to test whether you understand how the variable scope works in C programming. The given code is doing some computation, and we expect this program to print out `Answer: 86` as a result. Currently, the program prints out `Answer: 66`. 

Please understand the current code and the provided `foo()` and `bar()` functions, and then add ONE `foo()` and ONE `bar()` function calls in `main()` function such as the program prints out `Answer: 86`.

**IMPORTANT**: Your modification **MUST** be just adding `foo()` and `bar()` function call in `main()`. Other changes will result in a **ZERO** score.

**Hint**: You should use `printf()` to print out the value of all variables to help you figure out where should you call `foo()` and `bar()` functions in `main()`.
