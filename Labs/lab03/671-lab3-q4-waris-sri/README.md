# Count and Sum Odd Numbers

Write a program to receive input digits (0-9) until a user input a character 'q'.  

Count how many odd numbers users have been input and its summation. Print out the total number of the input odd numbers and its sum, separated by a colon (no space) 

**Hint**: use char type as an input and use ASCII to determine the value of digits, e.g., ASCII of '0' is 48, ASCII of '1' is 49.
