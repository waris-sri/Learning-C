## Print Values in 1D Array

Write a program to receive an array of size `n`, and then print outs of its elements in both forward and backward directions.

Suppose a user specifies `n=6` and input the following numbers:
```
6
4 7 9 13 2 99
```
The program will print all of its elements in forward and backward directions:
```
4 7 9 13 2 99 
99 2 13 9 7 4 
```
