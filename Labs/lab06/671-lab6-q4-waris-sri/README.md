## Dot Product

Write a program to compute a dot product operation.

First, the program receives an integer, `n` (assume that `n>0`), and creates two arrays of size `n`. Then it asks the user to fill in **integer numbers** for both arrays (one-by-one). Then, compute and print out the dot-product between the two arrays.

Suppose we specify two arrays: `A={1,2,3,4,5}` and `B={8,1,2,3,4}` as follows:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
8 1 2 3 4
```

The dot-product between these two arrays can be computed as follows:

```
Aâ€¢B = (A1*B1) + (A2*B2) + (A3*B3) + (A4*B4) + (A5*B5)
    = (1*8) + (2*1) + (3*2) + (4*3) + (5*4)
    = 48
```

**Note**: You must use arrays to store the input numbers and perform the operations from the arrays, otherwise, you will get a ZERO score.
