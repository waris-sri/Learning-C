## Sort Three Strings

Write a program that uses the built-in functions in `string.h` to sort THREE input strings.

In particular, the program first receives three input strings (each has the maximum length of 10 characters). Then it sorts them in ascending order (A-Z). Finally, it prints out the output.


The following cases are the example of the inputs and their corresponding output.

**Case 1**

Sample input:
```
zero
one
two
```

Sample output:
```
one
two
zero
```

**Case 2**

Sample input:
```
Jan
Feb
Mar
```

Sample output:
```
Feb
Jan
Mar
```

**Case 3**

Sample input:
```
ITCS113
itcs113
@itcs113
```

Sample output:
```
@itcs113
ITCS113
itcs113
```
