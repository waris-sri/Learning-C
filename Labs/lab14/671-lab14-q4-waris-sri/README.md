Write a program to create an array of BankAccount structures containing the following values:


| Acc. Number | Bank Name    | Balance    |
| ----------- | ------------ |----------- |
| 11111       | Bangkok_Bank | 100.50     |
| 12345       | Bangkok_Bank | 333.33     |
| 65444       | SCB          | 999.90     |
| 34545       | SCB          | 5000.55    |

Then, display each bank account information from the last record to the first record.

**Expected Output**
```
34545 -> 5000.55 [SCB]
65444 -> 999.90 [SCB]
12345 -> 333.33 [Bangkok_Bank]
11111 -> 100.50 [Bangkok_Bank]
```

**Extra practices (optinal, no test cases, but highly recommend to try)**
- Extend your code to compute the mean/min/max of the balance from all accounts in the BankAccount array.
