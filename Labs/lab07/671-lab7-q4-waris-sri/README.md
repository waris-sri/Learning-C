## Matrix Transpose

Write a program to create and print out the transpose of an input matrix.

In particular, the program first receives the number of rows (`n`) and columns (`m`) for the input matrix. Then it asks the user to fill in the values. After that the program **creates another matrix** to store the transpose of the input matrix. Finally, it prints out the results.

**IMPORTANT: You MUST create another matrix (i.e., another 2-D array) to store the transpose of the input matrix, and prints out the results from such matrix. Otherwise, you will get a ZERO score.**
