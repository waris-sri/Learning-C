## Prime number

You are given a code skeleton for a program to determine whether an input integer is a prime number. Write the body of the function to complete the program.

To simplify the problem, you can assume that the input integers in the test cases are always `>=2`.

**Hint**: A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a **prime number** (or a **prime**) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers (i.e, it is ONLY divisible by 1 and itself).

<hr />

**Case 1**

Sample input:
```
4
```
Sample output:
```
4 is NOT a prime number.
```

**Case 2**

Sample input:
```
19
```
Sample output:
```
19 is a prime number.
```
