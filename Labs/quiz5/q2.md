# Library Book Search (10 Points)

## Problem Statement
A library stores a collection of book titles. Write a program that searches for books containing a specific keyword (**case-sensitive**). You must implement a function named `containsKeyword` that checks if the keyword exists as a substring of a book title.

---

## Function Definition
You must write the following function:

```c
int containsKeyword(char *title, char *keyword);
```
#### Function Details:

1. Use a manual substring search to check if the keyword exists within title.
2. Use nested loops:
 * Outer loop: Iterate over all possible starting positions in `title`.
 * Inner loop: Compare the characters of `keyword` with the corresponding characters in `title`.
3. Return `1` if a match is found, or `0` if no match is found.

#### Hints for Writing the Function

* Use the `strlen()` function to calculate the lengths of `title` and `keyword`.
* The outer loop should iterate through `title` from index `0` to `(length of title - length of keyword)`.
* The inner loop compares each character of `keyword` with the corresponding characters in `title`. If a mismatch occurs, break out of the loop.
* If all characters of `keyword` match, return `1`. Otherwise, return `0`

## Requirements
1. Read the total number of books (`n`) in the library `(1 ≤ n ≤ 10)`.
2. Read `n` book titles, each up to 50 characters long.
3. Read a single search keyword (up to 50 characters).
4. Use the `containsKeyword` function to determine if each title contains the keyword.
5. Print the matching book titles or "**No Match**" if no books contain the keyword.

### Input Format
* Line 1: An integer `n`, the number of books.
* Next `n` lines: Each line contains a book title.
* Last line: A single keyword to search for.

*Using* `fgets()` *function reads a line of input from the user, including the newline character* (`\n`) *, if space allows. make sure to remove it*

### Output Format
* One matching book title per line (in the same order as input).
* If no book matches, output: **No Match**.
