# Computing GPA and Student Status

## Background

A student takes many courses per semester. The GPA of a semester can be computed from the sum of grade x credits divided by total credits. For example, if a student enrolls and gets grades:

- ITCS113,Fundamentals of Programming,3,A
- ITLG111,Technical English I,2,B
- ITCS111,Linear Algebra and Calculus for Computing,3,B+

This student will get GPA of

```plaintext
((3 x 4.0) + (2 * 3.0) + (3 * 3.5)) / 8 = 3.56
```

\*used only two decimal places

The status of a student depends on the GPA, following the rules below:

- GPA >= 2.0, Status: `"NORMAL"`
- GPA >= 1.8 and GPA < 2.0, Status: `"PRO 2"`
- GPA >= 1.5 and GPA < 1.8, Status: `"PRO 1"`
- GPA < 1.5, Status: `"RETIRED"`

## Instruction

This question has five parts. You should first read the overall code in the main.c and then start writing your code one part at a time.

1. [TODO 1, 1 pt] Declare a structure name Course. A course consists of
   - Course ID (e.g., `"ITCS113"`)
   - Course Name (e.g., `"Fundamentals of Programming"`)
   - Credit (e.g., `3`)
   - Grade (e.g., `3.5`)
2. [TODO 2, 1 pt] Declare two function _prototypes_:

   - `create_course` takes a string in the CSV format and return the structure course. An example of a function call is

     ```c
     struct Course c = create_course("ITCS113,Fundamental of Programming,3,B+");
     ```

   - `compute_gpa` takes an array of courses, number of courses, and status string; and return the GPA. Additionally, set the status string. An example of a function call is

     ```c
     int n = 7;
     char status[10];
     struct Course courses[n] = {...};  // init the courses

     gpa = compute_gpa(courses, n, status);
     ```

3. [TODO 3, 1 pt] Print the course ID, course name, credit, and grade.
4. [TODO 4, 4 pt] Define the function `create_course` (declare in TODO 2). We will assume that the string argument always has the correct formatting. An example of a function call is

   ```c
   struct Course c = create_course("ITCS113,Fundamental of Programming,3,B+");
   // c will contain the following information
   // Course ID: "ITCS113"
   // Course Name: "Fundamentals of Programming"
   // Credit: 3
   // Grade: 3.5
   ```

   To help you process this, we defined a helper function for you.

   ```c
   void parse_course(char line[], char *course_id, char *course_name, int *credit, float *grade);
   ```

   This function converts a string `line` into the course ID, course name, credit, and grade; and sets them into the pointers: `course_id`, `course_name`, `credit`, and `grade` respectively.

   Calling this function correctly will give you 1 point.

5. [TODO 5, 3 pt] Define the function `compute_gpa` (declare in TODO 2). An example of a function call is

   ```c
   int n = 3;
   char status[10];
   struct Course courses[] = {
       {"ITCS113","Fundamentals of Programming",3,2.0},
       {"ITLG111","Technical English I",2,1.5}
   }

   float gpa = compute_gpa(courses, n, status);
   // gpa is 1.80
   // status is "PRO 2"
   ```
